 *  ******************************
 *  The qualities of this formula "H" play a central role in information theory as 
 *  measure of information, 
 *  choice and uncertainty. 
 *  This measure for example is the H in Boltzmann's famous H Theorem.
 *
 *  This quantity has some interesting properties:
 *  > 1. When we are certain of the outcomes in a set of observations 
 *    does H vanish, otherwise H is positive.
 *  > 2. For a total of m possible results in a set of observations, 
 *    H is maximum when all proportions of this possibilities are equal. 
 *    This is also the most uncertain situation.
 *  > 3. The uncertainty is never increased by experience. 
 *    It will be decreased unless this experience is 
 *    irrelevant (independent), in which case uncertainty is not changed
